# doris-tech-blog
This is a  tech blog where I share my passion and knowledge of development. It is a responsive and user-friendly website where all the blog articles come from a headless CMS service called Sanity. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, my blog content is designed to inform and engage.

## Live Demo
Click [here](doris-techblog.vercel.app/) to view the live demo.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
